# Image-Registration-using-Matlab
Image registration is the procedure consisting of aligning an unregistered image (also called moving image) into a template image (also called fixed image) via a geometric transformation. This problem is usually addressed as presented in Fig. 1. An iterative procedure takes place to infer the geometric transformation (parametric or non-parametric) via an optimizer, which maximizes the similarity between the two images.
